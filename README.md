# Diffusion LoRA Style Transfer

This project aims to tackle Neural Style Transfer problem using fine-tuned diffusion model with LoRA technique.

### LoRA finetuning
```bash
./scripts/train.sh
```

### Transfer style to content image
```bash
./scripts/infer_img.sh
```

### Apply style to all content images in a folder
```bash
./scripts/infer_img.sh
```
